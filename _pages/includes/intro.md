I am currently a Eng.D. candidate at the [College of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme-college.fudan.edu.cn/main.htm), Fudan University (复旦大学生物医学工程与技术创新学院). My research focuses on AI-driven medical image analysis, including mainstream tasks such as segmentation, classification, anomaly detection, and image translation. Recently, my research interests have shifted toward multimodal ultrasound/photoacoustic imaging.

I graduated from [College of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://jkxy.swun.edu.cn/), Southwest Minzu University (西南民族大学计算机科学与人工智能学院) with a bachelor's degree and from the College of Computer Science and Mathematics, Fujian University of Technology (福建理工大学计算机科学与数学学院) with a master's degree, advised by Professor [Zuoyong Li (李佐勇)](https://jsj.mju.edu.cn/2025/0227/c6122a195672/page.htm).

Currently, I am conducting my studies at the [Intelligent Medical Ultrasound Laboratory](https://imu.fudan.edu.cn/index.htm) (IMU Lab). Under the supervision of Professor [Xin Liu (刘欣)](https://bme-college.fudan.edu.cn/lx1/main.htm), my research focuses on deep learning-based ultrasound imaging. I have published 5+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=srI1hRMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FLQH89757%2Flinqinghua.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international journoal.
