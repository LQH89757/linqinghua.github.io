I am currently a Eng.D. candidate at the [College of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme-college.fudan.edu.cn/main.htm), Fudan University (复旦大学生物医学工程与技术创新学院). My research focuses on AI-driven medical image analysis, including mainstream tasks such as segmentation, classification, anomaly detection, and image translation. Recently, my research interests have shifted toward multimodal ultrasound/photoacoustic imaging.

I graduated from [College of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://jkxy.swun.edu.cn/), Southwest Minzu University (西南民族大学计算机科学与人工智能学院) with a bachelor's degree and from the College of Computer Science and Mathematics, Fujian University of Technology (福建理工大学计算机科学与数学学院) with a master's degree, advised by [Zuoyong Li (李佐勇)](https://jsj.mju.edu.cn/2025/0227/c6122a195672/page.htm).
